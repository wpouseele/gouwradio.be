Thanks for trying out Streeme. While in alpha phase, there's a few hurdles to getting up and running, but anyone familiar with
using PHP or Google-fu should breeze through setting this stuff up quickly. 

Minimum Requirements 
---
256M RAM 
1GHz CPU 
PHP 5.2.4 +
Mysql 5.1.37+
Apache 2.0+


Web Server Installers
---
Mac please use macports / fink to roll your own Apache/PHP/MySQL - it will run on the default one too, but it's not very flexible
PC http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-windows.html
Ubuntu 8+ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP


Mysql config - add to my.cnf - on Macs you may need to copy my.cnf from the mysql install to /etc/
**Note: This app uses SQL specialized for MySQL
---
[mysqld]
default-character-set = utf8
default-collation = utf8_unicode_ci
query_cache_type = 1
query_cache_size  = 32M

*if you have other projects using MySQL on this server, you may want to choose to ignore the query cache steps to 
preserve compatibility with other projects


Apache Config - edit in apache2.conf / httpd.conf usually in /etc/
---
add mod-rewrite    *required
add mod-XSendFile  *optional
add deflate_module *optional
(or compile apache with this functionality if not using modules)

choose the right timezone for php date.timezone flag make sure your PC clock is the same region and time 

create a virtual host: 
(It's highly recommended that you choose a random unused port between 1025-9800 )

# This is the configuration for the streeme app communication path
Listen *:8095

# Be sure to only have this line once in your configuration
NameVirtualHost *:8095

<VirtualHost *:8095>
  DocumentRoot "d:/web/streeme/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>

  Alias /sf "d:/web/streeme/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf"
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

# This is the configuration for the music streamer
Listen *:8096

# Be sure to only have this line once in your configuration
NameVirtualHost *:8096

<VirtualHost *:8096>
  DocumentRoot "d:/web/streeme/web"
  DirectoryIndex index.php
  <Directory "d:/web/streeme/web">
    AllowOverride All
    Allow from All
  </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

#Disable SVN directory sniffing through apache
<Directory ~ ".*\.svn"> 
Order allow,deny 
Deny from all 
Satisfy All 
</Directory> 


PHP config - edit in php.ini and using the commandline for PEAR commands
---
turn off magic quotes gpc
developers should turn off short_tags
install PEAR - http://pear.php.net/manual/en/installation.php
sandboxed servers like xampp for windows come with pear already so just type in the following commands
  - pear install APC
  - pear install HTTP_Download

- increase max memory to 128M or higher in cli - 32MB or higher for web 
- large libraries will demand more memory use during scanning and GD may need to process up to 10MP JPEG images for cover art
curl required for cloudfusion: sudo apt-get install curl libcurl3 libcurl3-dev php5-curl 

You should validate your PHP install went right by running 

PHP MUST BE PART OF YOUR PATH!

>php check_configuration.php

in the root of this project  


Streeme Installation
---

Checkout the symfony framework into lib/vendor/symfony
pin your installation to a 1.4.8 tag: 
cd lib/vendor/symfony
svn co http://svn.symfony-project.com/tags/RELEASE_1_4_8/ .

rename config/databases.template.yml -> config/databases.yml
open config/databases.yml and fill in your database's username and password - grant privileges to create databases if you want auto setup
streeme is a MySQL only app at this time

rename apps/client/config/app.template.yml -> apps/client/config/app.yml
Fill in the information about the application and paths

permissions
*nix users - chmod 777 cache log
             in the project root folder, type: php symfony doctrine:build --all --and-load	

Windows -    check that cache and log have write permissions
             copy the symfony batch file from lib/vendor/symfony/data/bin/symfony.bat to the project root folder
             in the project root folder, type: symfony doctrine:build --all --and-load
	           copy the lib/vendor/symfony/data/web/sf folder to web/

initialize the database as follows

*nix
cd path/to/streeme
./symfony doctrine:build --all --and-load

windows
cd path/to/streeme
php symfony doctrine:build --all --and-load

tested on symfony 1.4.8 - 1.4.9-dev branch between September 28,2010 and  November 30, 2010


FFMPEG
---
ubuntu: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1117283 install ffmpeg from the medibuntu distro on ubuntu. You'll need medibuntu to enjoy mp3 support in chrome on ubuntu anyway.

mac: use macports to build your very own ffmpeg - takes a good long time to build if you don't use macports on a regular basis. Please follow the directions at macports.org for more info about this package manager.

>sudo port -v selfupdate

>port search ffmpeg

>sudo port install ffmpeg +gpl +lame +aac

mac and ubuntu: make ffmpeg part of your path and enter "ffmpeg" in the entry for ffmpeg_executable and set allow_ffmpeg_transcoding: true
 
windows: you'll need to find an appropriate FFMPEG client - they change all the time, so it's useless giving links - you need lame (mp3) and vorbis (ogg) support
         Audacity, an open source sound editor, has a number of prebuilt FFMPEG libs
         
windows:  place the binaries in Your_Streeme_Project_Dir/bin/third_party/ffmpeg and set ffmpeg_executable: c:\path\to\ffmpeg.exe allow_ffmpeg_transcoding: true


Amazon Art Scanning

Amazon offers significant detail about albums and advertising links for associates. Please keep in mind that your system clock must be within 15 minutes of the correct time for your time zone
edit the cloudfusion config file in apps/client/config
