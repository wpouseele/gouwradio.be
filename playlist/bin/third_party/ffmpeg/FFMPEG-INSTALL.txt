In order to use a number of Streeme's functions, you may choose to install FFMPEG binaries to this folder. 
You can set options about the FFMPEG path in the application configuration file. 

I have not included it with the Streeme project due to uncertainty about codec legality. It is NOT required for basic functionality

You install FFMPEG and codecs and libraries at your own peril.
